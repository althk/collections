## Collections

Set of generics-based, collection based data structures. Some of the collections provide thread-safe versions.

These data structures are based on [Algorithms, 4th Edition](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. All credit for the algorithms goes to the authors.

The package currently has the following data structures (all generics-based):

* MaxPQ - A basic max heap.
* ConcurrentMaxPQ - Thread-safe max heap.
* RBTree - An implementation of a red-black tree.
